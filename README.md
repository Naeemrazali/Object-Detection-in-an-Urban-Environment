# Object-Detection-in-an-Urban-Environment
Udacity project one (computer vision)

## Project Overview
Object detection is important for self-driving cars to be able to gain high level understanding of its environment from digital images captured from camera sensors. The car needs this information to be able to make optimal decisions such as at a stop sign or giving way to pedestrians at a zebra crossing. The aim of this project is to create a simple object detection model that can be used to identify cars, pedestrians, and cyclists from camera images.

# Dataset 

## Dataset Analysis
This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts and other visualizations

The dataset comes from the video feed of a camera attached to the front of a car. The dataset has images from a wide range of conditions. Weather conditions varied from sunny, cloudy and rainy. The camera was occasionally obscured by water droplets. Images were captured during the day and the night. Low light sensitivity of the camera sensor was poor, and reproduced a low amount of detail during night time scenes. The camera lense used did not have a wide FOV and lense distortion was minimal. Some scenes were void of any cars/pedestrians/cyclists. Other images were taken in the city with a high density of objects in the foreground and also background. Objects in the background would be of low resolution/blurry if size was too small.

## Cross Validation 
This section should detail the cross validation strategy and justify your approach 

# Training 

## Reference Experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should include training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performance. 

## Improvements Over Reference
 This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
